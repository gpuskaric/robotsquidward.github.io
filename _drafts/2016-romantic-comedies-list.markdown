After watching *Music and Lyrics* with my girlfriend this week, I categorized it in the good-not-great category of romantic comedies.  It was funny, cute, memorable, but it didn't quite have that serious impact that puts it among the all-time best for romantic comedies.

This line of thinking made me start to think about romantic comedies as a genre and about what makes a great romantic comedy.  I started thinking about all the great romantic comedies I've seen and how many I've heard of but haven't spent time with.  All of this made me think I had some potential room to grow in my film knowledge in an area of film that would be enjoyable to delve into - and in doing so I could start to articulate what makes a good romantic comedy and begin to compile a list of the all time greats.

So I think that's what I'm going to do.  Create a definitive must-watch list for romantic comedies as well as a bunch of runners-up and also-mentions.

I'm going to start with a list of romantic comedies I have to see, then the list of what I've seen, and finally with a ranked list using some criteria I have yet to determine.
