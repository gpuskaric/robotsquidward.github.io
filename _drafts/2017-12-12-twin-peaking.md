# Twin Peaking

Understanding how I ended up becoming a fan of Twin Peaks, and how I was able to consume and understand Twin Peaks *The Return*.

## Why watch *Twin Peaks*?

My journey towards Twin Peaks started back when I was in High School and I was introduced to the work of David Lynch.  At the time I was an aspiring director - obsessed with making films with my friends and consuming the popular works of every known director.  Me and my friends would regularly watch and swap movies by our favorite directors, and my friend Jon insisted we watch *Mulholland Drive* to understand the work of David Lynch.

The movie both bored me and blew my mind simultaneously.  What has stuck with me forever is the early diner 'dream' scene, and the rest has pretty much faded away.  What I remember the most from the experience was Jon explaining the movie to us afterwards and diving into the themes as he experienced them.

Years later, I took note when Twin Peaks ended up on Netflix streaming, and I tossed it in my queue to see what I would think.
