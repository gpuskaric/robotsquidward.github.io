# The Lego MOC

There's levels of Lego fans.  

Usually people become connected to Lego at a young age when they build and play with and destroy Legos as toys.  As they grow up, they learn not to destroy the bigger and more intricate models they build.  Often times grown up Lego fans become collectors for display and re-sale.  But there's another type of Lego builder - the MOC builder.

## What makes a MOC?

In Lego terms, MOC stands for *My Original Creation*.  Simply, they're Lego sets built sans-instructions.  But more accurately, they're intricate displays of Lego-based art.

Anything can be a MOC, but what stands out is when builders take existing Lego sets, themes, worlds, bricks - and they reimagine them in incredible ways.  Builders create scenes from films, build massive mechs and spacecraft, or invent characters as full builds or minifigures.

They take the raw material of Lego, and make something altogether new.  It speaks to both the creativity of these artists, and the versatility of these awesome plastic bricks.

## MOC Community

Pretty much since there has been Lego there have been Lego fan groups.  Builders meet to display their creations.
