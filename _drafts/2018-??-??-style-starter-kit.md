I've been paying attention to what I wear since about my third year in college - and really not much before then.  The summer after that year I lost about 20 lbs, and suddenly when faced with baggy clothes for the first time in awhile it was clear how far I had to go.

I started by reading [r/malefashionadvice]() on Reddit, and checking in to browse every [WAYWT]() post to try to get inspiration.  I was drawn in by its focus to casual, more affordable style focus that was attainable for a college student.  At the time I was mostly just trying to figure out what to wear out to bars that wasn't baggy jeans and a t-shirt.

After graduating I continued using Reddit as a resource as I built out some other essentials that I needed for my job (suit, formal shirts, shoes, etc.) and upgraded my casual wear and shoe collection.  I always checked [r/frugalmalefashion]() for deals, and began to learn what brands worked for me without having to check back with MFA for any decision.

It's been a little over three years since college, and I've spent a lot less time on my wardrobe as I did back then.  It comes a bit more naturally I think, and I have less time to be concerned about what will be next in my closet.
