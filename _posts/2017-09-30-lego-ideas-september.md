# Lego Ideas Roundup - September 2017

The [Lego Ideas](https://ideas.lego.com/dashboard) overflow!  I thought it was worth another roundup of some of my favorite fan-made Lego MOC's this month.

The Lego University is a Modular set that is surprisingly well put together for a MOC.  It's huge and intricate, including many of the stylized components that make up any college building.
