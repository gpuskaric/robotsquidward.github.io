…as I sigh, shudder, and forcefully slap my face with my palm yet again – my default reaction to most of the ongoing public debate over encryption.

Ars Technica will give you the details in [their article]( http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/02/arizona-prosecutor-were-not-buying-any-more-iphones-over-apple-and-doj-dispute/), but let me give you the TL;DR.

People don’t know what they’re talking about (big surprise) when it comes to encryption, but yet they can’t restrain themselves from talking (big surprise) about it as if they are the experts.
This blowhard prosecutor in Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, AZ and surrounding areas, has basically said that because Apple is refusing to cooperate with the FBI’s orders to unlock an iPhone linked to a terrorist attack, they are on the terrorists’ side.  As such, they’ve decided to stop buying iPhones for the employees of their agency.

A more accurate description of Tim Cook’s allegiance is not to terrorists but to his customers.  Millions of which could be at risk of a loss of security if Apple is compelled to comply with the FBI’s current orders.

Here’s my favorite quote from this article on Ars:

>"If the potential for unauthorized access to an encryption key is truly motivating Apple’s unwillingness to assist in downloading information from specific iPhones, then let’s define the problem in those terms and work on that concern," Montgomery added. "Otherwise, Apple is proving indifferent to the need for evidence to hold people accountable who have harmed or intend to harm fellow citizens."

I would say to Mr. Montgomery – read [the letter Tim Cook wrote](http://www.apple.com/customer-letter/).

Here’s my response to this logic:

Best way keep the key out of the wrong hands – don’t create it in the first place.  The debate *is* defined by those terms.  I would also ask who he expects to manage and protect his hypothetical key.
His argument also represents the blindness of most arguments against mine and Apple’s point of view.  There is no concern from this conservative crusader for justice that the government or law enforcement agencies could abuse, misuse, or mishandle the software or ‘key’ that the FBI demands Apple create.  This blindness to the perspective that this debate is not just a single issue where Apple stands as a barrier between law enforcement and justice in this one case – it’s an existential argument about the power of government reach and the privacy of American citizens.

The Verge is following this debate pretty well with a [timeline stream](http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/17/11036306/apple-fbi-iphone-encryption-backdoor-tim-cook).  I’ve also been following up with reactions to choice breaking stories and I probably will have more rage-posts in the future.
