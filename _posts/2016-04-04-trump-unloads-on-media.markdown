The TRUMP campaign's senior advisor Barry Bennet wrote an internal memo on April 2nd - [published by the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/04/04/internal-memo-reveals-trump-campaigns-mounting-fury-with-its-critics/) - that bashed the media and Republican establishment on their TRUMP-focused criticisms that seemingly reached a head in the past week.

In the memo with subject reading "*Digging through the Bull Shit*", Bennett calls out the media's overt targeting of TRUMP and retorts that despite their media hits TRUMP continues to rise in the polls.

While Mr. Bennett is ready to frame this as a victory despite the odds, I see it a little differently.

When every news outlet exposes TRUMP's flaws, in both conservative and mainstream media, does that really speak to your strength as a candidate?  Or does it rather highlight the issues on which he falters as a candidate for most voters?

It might be my more moderate-to-left standpoint - [more likely to see the mainstream media as factually accurate and reliable](http://www.vox.com/2016/4/1/11340882/republicans-democrats-media-fox) - but I just don't understand how so many voters can see blatantly defying information sources as a sign that their viewpoint is fair and accurate.  When everyone who knows anything about politics is reporting that TRUMP is a deeply flawed and divisive candidate, what makes you think you know better?  Gut feel and an blind patriotism?

I think I might be more annoyed with the apparent idiocy of such a large chunk of the GOP voter base and the entire TRUMP campaign than Barry is with the establishment "Bull Shit".

### P.S.

I read [this article on Politico](http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/04/donald-trump-foreign-policy-experts-221528) later in the day.  This TRUMP quote just about sums it up:

>"You know, I’ve always wanted to say this—I’ve never said this before with all the talking we all do—all of these experts, 'Oh we need an expert—' **The experts are terrible**," he declared. "Look at the mess we’re in with all these experts that we have. Look at the mess. Look at the Middle East. **If our presidents and our politicians went on vacation for 365 days a year and went to the beach, we’d be in much better shape right now** in the Middle East.”

**Fucking drivel.**
