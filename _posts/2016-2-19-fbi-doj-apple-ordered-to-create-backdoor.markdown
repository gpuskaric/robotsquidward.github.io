I wrote a short post about encryption with a slightly positive twist on Monday.  That was nice.

This Tuesday, a U.S. District court ruled that Apple must break or circumvent the security on the iPhone 5C that was involved in the San Bernardino terrorist attacks this December.

On Wednesday, Tim Cook wrote an [open letter to customers](apple.com/customer-letter) where he warned customers and all of us about the dangers of this kind of request.  It's a good read, and explains many of what have been my own concerns.

In the wake of the letter, the discussion has basically gone viral, blowing up this encryption discussion to a whole new level - maybe the only good news in this turn of events.  Everyone has been weighing in, including the viral maniac Donald J. Trump himself who has gone so far as to [call for a boycott](http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/19/11071684/donald-trump-apple-boycott-encryption-iphone/in/10800347) of apple products (*give me a break*).

Apple has said it will file to object the request from the FBI/DOJ, and has been granted three additional days to make it's decision.  Ars Technica has an [interesting piece](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2016/02/how-apple-will-fight-the-doj-in-iphone-backdoor-crypto-case/) on how Apple will likely approach its appeal.

This story is compelling and terrifying all at once, to myself and anyone in technology and security.  It's also worrying as American citizens, who should be skeptical of our government's reach in matters such as these.  The Verge [writes at length](http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/19/11064054/apple-fbi-lockscreen-encryption-passcode-backdoor/in/10800347) about the dangers the sort of tool that Apple would build could have to the security of our devices, not just the possibility that hackers could potentially compromise and use the software to hack other devices, but even more likely and more worrying to me is that our government agencies could likely use this move as precedent to make these requests at their whim.

My request for anyone reading - educate yourself on this issues.  We can't afford to give up our privacy on an issue like this because it's emotional.  It behooves us to think about the future and about the implications of our actions.

The Verge is keeping track of this story as it develops [here](http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/17/11036306/apple-fbi-iphone-encryption-backdoor-tim-cook).
