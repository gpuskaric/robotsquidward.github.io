# Buying a Couch on a Budget

I recently moved into a new apartment, and realized that over half my furniture actually belonged to my previous roommate.  I've done some stocking up, but the last big ticket item on my list is a couch.

I've been searching for one for awhile, and thinking about it for longer, but all my options seem to be coming up short.  This is my musings on buying a couch on a budget.

## What I Want

What I want in a couch is a sleek, modern/mid-century minimalist design.  Something with cool wooden legs and sharp angles.  Nothing fluffy or gaudy or velvet or leather either.  I'd love it to not look like shit in five years and I'd like it to fit in my living room.

## What I Have

I'm on a budget of about $1,000.  That means I have to compromise.  

## Options Considered

* Ikea
  * Nockeby sectional
  * Nockeby sofa
  * Kivik sofa
  * Kivik sectional
* west elm
  * Leon
  * Brooklyn
* Wayfair
  * Carnmore Sofa
