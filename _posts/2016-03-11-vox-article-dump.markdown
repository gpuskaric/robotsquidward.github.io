In the wake of what seems like a barrage of primary debates over the course of the last few weeks I have been devouring articles on the race and on political themes and policy voraciously.

Some of the most interesting articles came from [*Vox*](http://www.vox.com/), one of my favorite political news sites.  *Vox* specializes in explainer journalism, breaking down issues and explaining policy in more of a straightforward style - like very professional political blog posts but with less opinion based writing.

This week I read a series of really good articles that I feel I have to share.  They all follow a loosely similar theme - analyzing major changes in the political landscape and/or explaining historical changes that have brought us to this point.  The loose themes are Neoconservatism and the state of the Republican Party as well as, more broadly, U.S. Foreign Policy.

#### Here are the articles I recommend reading

They are listed chronologically and, coincidentally, in the order in which I read them:

1.  [America's unlearned lesson: the forgotten truth about why we invaded Iraq](http://www.vox.com/2016/2/16/11022104/iraq-war-neoconservatives)
2. [Obamacare didn’t pave the way for Donald Trump. The GOP’s response to it did.](http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/3/9/11182590/obamacare-donald-trump)
3. [Twilight of the neoconservatives](http://www.vox.com/2016/3/10/11189350/twilight-of-the-neoconservatives)
4. [The best articulation yet of how President Obama sees the world](http://www.vox.com/2016/3/10/11194036/obama-worldview-atlantic)

#### Here's my TL;DR overviews:

1. The first article sets the stage for explaining kind of the rise of Neoconservatism and its impact on the invasion of Iraq and how that shaped the trajectory of U.S. interests in the Middle East and our Foreign Policy over the last two decades.

2. The second article pivots to the domestic issue of Obamacare, and responds to another article blaming the political polarization in America on Obamacare.  The argument instead is that the Republican leadership's pitch to their electorate - that Obamacare was a partisan effort to sideline the democratic process and shove a partisan policy down the throats of the Republican electorate - has backfired in recent years as the Republican 'establishment' has failed to undo the early work done in the President's first term.  It's relevant to the race, as we see the Republican electorate basically getting fed up with these 'establishment' types who have failed to deliver on their promises in their eyes (promises that were probably not very honest to begin with).

3. This article kind of jumps off the platform built in the first article.  It follows the rise and fall of Neoconservatism as a political ideology and as a powerhouse in the Republican party.  It helps to explain the current state of the party as well as the Trump-fueled schism happening now around that viewpoint.

4. I read this article this morning.  It's a look at President Obama's Foriegn Policy world view.  His so-called 'Hobbesian Optimism' about America and how that has shaped his actions during his presidency.  I really enjoyed  reading it, probably because my own personal views on foreign policy tend to mirror those same themes of general optimism with shades of curmudgeonly hesitation.

That's it this week!  Hope you enjoy reading.
