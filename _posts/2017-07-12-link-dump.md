title: Link Dump (also hi)

First, a moment to say `Hello World!` yet again as I rebuild this blog once more `:)`

### Link Dump

I've been consuming [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) voraciously and done a lot more long reading in the last month or so.  I came across a few good articles to share that I just haven't gotten a chance to share yet.  I'm just going to toss them in here as a list of recommendations.

## [The Secret Origin Story of the iPhone](https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15782200/one-device-secret-history-iphone-brian-merchant-book-excerpt)

This is an excerpt from a book by Brian Merchant - "*The One Device: The Secret History of the iPhone*".  The book is a deep look at how the iconic device got made.  I was in rapture as I read this excerpt on The Verge, and I immediately went out and pre-ordered it.  I'll try to do a mini-review of the whole work after I get to read it.  

From the first few chapters I can tell you its not just the politics and intrigue of the iPhone's creating at Apple, but also a sprawling investigation into the physical construction of the iPhone and its impact on the world.

## [The Finish Tomb for Nuclear Waste](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/olkiluoto-island-finland-nuclear-waste-onkalo)

This was a really awesome article I ran across on HN a few weeks ago.  It is a story about the construction of a massive permanant nuclear waste storage facility being built on Olkiluoto Island in western Finland.  The repository, called Onkalo, is built to last for 100,000 years - enough time to allow the toxic waste within de-radiate.  It's an eerie tale about human discovery and the ramifications.

## [Android `ViewModel`](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel.html)

The thing that has my attention the most coming out of [Google I/O](https://events.google.com/io/recap/) was the substantial architecture changes coming to Android in O.  This link is basically a reminder for myself to learn more about it and hopefully share how I use it in my own development.  For now, take a look at what they can do for yourself.

The one minute gist is you can now have Lifecycle-aware components that survive for the lifecycle of your activity and can be used to manage data for your Activities and their Fragments in a much cleaner and safer way then the previous patterns.  Implement a `ViewModel` and implement listeners to its members and you can create clean reactive Fragments easily.

### That's it for now...

More to come with this blog.  For now it's a simpler more cleaner site setup that I can hopefully be vigilant in updating moving forward.  Thanks for reading.
