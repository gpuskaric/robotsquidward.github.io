It interests me how blinded people are to external realities.

I spent the weekend at my extended family's farm.  There, opinions echo back and forth in the isolation.  Homes are separated by miles, and communities are held together by religious practices familial bonds.  They hear messages from the outside, but from outsiders.  Their lives are built around a moral code handed down to them from neighbors, parents, and priests.

It's an interesting world to walk into.

My family, who live mostly in the suburbs of a small-to-medium sized city, are seen as the 'city folks'.  By definition we don't understand the lives and the values of their culture.  How could we?  My parents are still very much a part of this mentality, but their children have never lived that life.  Our bonds to that mindset are tenuous.  I see more than one point of view.

This is all a lot of prologue to a topic not quite so existential (though maybe it is) - the GOP position in Washington right now and the mindsets that affect it.

## The GOP and their image problem

The GOP, despite their dominance in the legislature of late, is in a time of crisis.

One is named Trump.

The other is a lot more existential, and needs to be described with a bit more history - although it goes hand-in-hand with the rise of Trump.  That is, the image problem the Republican Party has with it's conservative base.  A base that has been promised action on their steadfast conservative goals, and consistently let down by their elected.

There was an [article in *Vox*](http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2016/3/9/11182590/obamacare-donald-trump) a while ago, that talked a bit about Obamacare and how it was the Republican response to Obamacare that helped to cause this massive polarization of the GOP and this intense battle between Republican legislative groups, rather than Obamacare itself.  Essentially, what has happened is that the GOP rose up in arms - along with groups like the Tea Party - in a massive opposition to Obamacare and the progressive steps the government had taken in the first years of the Obama presidency.  Republican candidates ran on a promise to reverse the actions taken by Obama and to repeal Obamacare.  They won with this promise.  Then, year after year, they failed to deliver on their promise.

It's not really the fault of these individual men and women that they couldn't repeal Obamacare.  The fact is that it would have been extremely difficult to reverse the progress made after it has been put in place.  The GOP arguably knew this all along, but even if not, they are dealing with that fact now.  To many Republican voters, their elected have failed them.

So now we have the GOP 'Establishment' who have basically been working to maintain leadership in their party by fighting for what they believe are true Republican ideals.  They're doing this by guarding traditional conservative economic ideals by creating economically conservative legislation or by blocking progressive legislature - but are continuing to let down their electorate by not delivering the impossible that they promised.

The problem is you have this huge conglomerate of Republican or conservative voters out here who have deeply held opinions on what their government should or shouldn't be - what their country should and shouldn't look like.  In their eyes important issues to them are being overlooked, bad deals are being made, promises are being broken, and even where establishment ideals mesh with theirs little is being done.

What I hear complaints about from my very conservative, religious family:

* Obamacare is bad and should go away (isn't going to happen, at least not how they'd like)
* Defund Planned Parenthood and repeal Roe V. Wade (can't imagine this is plausible, but regressions in this area are troubling)
* Fight ISIS aka Fight Muslims - whether they know they are saying that or not (fear mongering is working, and my very religious family is very willing to blame an ideology they don't understand)
* Just generally get Obama out of the White House and restore the world to an order where we can keep ourselves from teetering on the edge of the pits of Hell and eternal darkness.  Again, fear mongering.

I don't hear so much about the economy and creating more tax breaks for their tax bracket - though this underpins much of it - my family is more concerned with the social order of this country that they believe in, and that they believe is slipping away.

So we have a fundamental problem when we talk about compromising with Democrats on legislation.  There is this belief that we must stand firm on our conservative grounds.  Pass nothing (except tax breaks).  Repeal progress made over the last decade in healthcare, in education.  Undo the social norm we as a country have come to accept.

## GOP V. SCOTUS

What initially spurred this now-rambling blog post is an [article in *Politico*](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/supreme-court-conservatives-mcconnell-221161) about the reaction to the GOP Establishment's call to block Obama's Supreme Court nomination of judge Merrick Garland, and about the potential backlash that would ensue if Mitch McConnell and the rest of the establishment backtracked on their blockade.

Essentially, what we've run into is a similar issue.  On the one hand you have conservatives and elites who [don't necessarily agree with McConnell and crew](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/redstates-scotus-wva-221226) about [blocking this SCOTUS nomination](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/poll-senate-supreme-court-nominee-221168) (at least outright denying to hear anything about it), and on the other hand you have conservatives applauding this steady and unwavering stance taken by the party leadership (and [threatening against](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/03/supreme-court-conservatives-mcconnell-221161) any concessions).

McConnell and the more pragmatic Republican leaders are trying to walk this tightrope.  They don't want to seem like they aren't doing anything, and they also don't want to look like they're wavering in the face of pressure from liberals.  It's an unenviable position, no doubt.

So when it boils down to it, we basically have a fragmented GOP base who is hardlined on a lot of social issues that are very hard to address in the way they imagine, and a GOP leadership more interested in making conservative plays in areas they appreciate (and likely think their electorate will appreciate).  The leaders are in a tough spot because doing nothing is bad, but doing anything bi-partisan is also bad.  Meanwhile, this conservative base is growing more and more restless with their actions or inactions or compromised action that they're ready for a complete upheaval of the whole system (which I still don't really understand).  Enter Donald J. Trump.

## TRUMP mania

I'm not going to do a whole blog post part 2 on Trump here, but it's interesting how he plays in.

GOP leaders and legislators are paralyzed by fragmentation in the party.  This paralysis is angering voters, and compromise in response to this anger is further angering voters.

Simply put, the GOP 'Establishment' and the elected leaders can't be trusted.  To the voters, they need someone with the balls to stand up and take charge and *deliver* on their calls.

To them, this is Trump.  It almost makes sense.  It's *almost* relatable.

The problem is this man they have chosen to take up their charge is a racist, a misogynist, a liar, a dope, a bully, and a fraud.

This is what I don't understand.  How can people (like my own parents) who value social issues like being anti-abortion and religious protections as much or more than economic or immigration or foreign policy issues can choose Trump of all people to be their standard bearer?  The man isn't religious, is literally running on tearing down religious liberty, and breaks from the conservative right mostly on social or religious issues like his stance on Israel or his stance on Planned Parenthood.

It's this whole terrifying thing of us versus them.  This [authoritarian viewpoint of the world](http://www.vox.com/2016/3/1/11127424/trump-authoritarianism) that people right now are unfortunately drawn to, that frankly I just don't understand.

> I'm actually more sympathetic to authoritarianism than I'd probably like to admit.  The difference between me and many Americans is that I don't think we're in the danger that they think we are in.  We don't need to turn to this destructive mindset.  Not ever, but especially not now.

We're Americans.  We're living in one of the greatest countries on the planet in our time and place.  Our economy is better now than it was  when Obama first took office.  We're getting paid more, more of us are working, and we are systematically more tolerant and welcoming than we have been in many ways.  What then, is this huge uproar truly about?

I think it's about this narrative spun by the right.  The narrative that Obama is the wrong man for the job.  That his attempt at offering more Americans proper medical care was a massive overreach in executive power by liberals in government.  That the GOP has lost control of the country they held.  That the only way to keep things the way they like them is to burn the whole thing down - to reject all who threaten their regressive way of life.  To be more hostile, less welcoming.

It's a terrifying trend.  I just wish we could wake up from this misplaced, apocalyptic fervor.

## A final TL;DR

This has been a true mess of a blog post (it was cathartic at least), but if you read it I hope you can see where I'm coming from.

**TL;DR - The GOP has spun a self serving narrative that has turned self destructive.  Trump is a horrible human being and should be discarded and forgotten so America can realize how great it is, and progress towards a better future.**
