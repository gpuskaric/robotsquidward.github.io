I heard the news today that Rostam was leaving Vampire Weekend from [an article on The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2016/1/26/10833914/vampire-weekend-rostam-batmanglij-quit-band), and I was deeply saddened.  Sad in that optimistic way where you're happy for your friend but sad to see them go.

Rostam was such a big part of VW, but I'm not surprised to see him go.  He is immensely talented, and has proven his musical chops outside of the band in the past.  His collaboration with Ra Ra Riot's Wesley Miles, Discovery, sounds like the spiritual love child of the two bands' sounds and is one of my favorite albums of its kind.

His new music has begun to trickle out as well, including a great single "EOS" which sounds like an echo of both Discovery and Vampire Weekend - in the best possible way.

Long story short - this is sad news for a long time Vampire Weekend fan, who would just as soon see him continue to elevate that great band, but I'm also extremely excited to see what this talented musician has in the pipeline on his own.

I can't wait to listen.
