A round up of some new stuff to check out this week.

## The Shins new album *Heartworms*

Okay technically I've been listening to *Heartworms* for two weeks now.  The Shins newest release is another incremental evolution for the music of James Mercer.  Check out songs *Heartworms*, *Fantasy Island*, and *Cherry Hearts* for a taste of my fav's.   Also - the rest - [Spotify Link](https://open.spotify.com/album/51q9Mkz5BVwTRYsMlLASVZ)

## Silicon Valley Season 4

The fourth season of Silicon Valley is back!  Sunday's episode returns with the Pied Piper gang working on Dinesh's new video chat app and trying to shop it around to the VC's of Silicon Valley.  Meanwhile, Richard is in turmoil about his personal future.  

The episode wraps up heading in a really interesting direction, mixing up some of the group dynamics.  I'm excited to see where the show goes this season.

P.S. Veep is new this week too.  The show is regaining a its edge a bit with Selena back at the bottom.

## Guy Billout

I stumbled across the work of Guy Billout for the first time this weekend and I was really blow away by it.  It's surrealist and thought provoking and colorful and funny.  Truly great stuff.

Check out his work at [his website](http://www.guybillout.com/).  It's a little dated and low-res, but all still very cool.  Let me know if you know of a way to snag a print.

## Kevin Morby's 2014 album *Still Life*

This one is a new-to-me thing, but anyway, check out this album - [Spotify Link](https://open.spotify.com/album/3tQTQZ8oy2IDwpmkYP08Fr)
