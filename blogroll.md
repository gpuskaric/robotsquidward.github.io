title: Blogroll
---

One of my 2018 resolutions is to cultivate a blogroll of writers and blogs that I like.  More for my benefit than anyone else's, but hopefully anyone can benefit.

This goes hand in hand with my resolution to write more here.  Working on it.

Until I have this done, just assume I'm with everyone else on [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/ajkueterman).
