<p>The TRUMP campaign’s senior advisor Barry Bennet wrote an internal memo on April 2nd - <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/04/04/internal-memo-reveals-trump-campaigns-mounting-fury-with-its-critics/">published by the Washington Post</a> - that bashed the media and Republican establishment on their TRUMP-focused criticisms that seemingly reached a head in the past week.</p>

<p>In the memo with subject reading “<em>Digging through the Bull Shit</em>”, Bennett calls out the media’s overt targeting of TRUMP and retorts that despite their media hits TRUMP continues to rise in the polls.</p>

<p>While Mr. Bennett is ready to frame this as a victory despite the odds, I see it a little differently.</p>

<p>When every news outlet exposes TRUMP’s flaws, in both conservative and mainstream media, does that really speak to your strength as a candidate?  Or does it rather highlight the issues on which he falters as a candidate for most voters?</p>

<p>It might be my more moderate-to-left standpoint - <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/4/1/11340882/republicans-democrats-media-fox">more likely to see the mainstream media as factually accurate and reliable</a> - but I just don’t understand how so many voters can see blatantly defying information sources as a sign that their viewpoint is fair and accurate.  When everyone who knows anything about politics is reporting that TRUMP is a deeply flawed and divisive candidate, what makes you think you know better?  Gut feel and an blind patriotism?</p>

<p>I think I might be more annoyed with the apparent idiocy of such a large chunk of the GOP voter base and the entire TRUMP campaign than Barry is with the establishment “Bull Shit”.</p>

<p>I read <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/04/donald-trump-foreign-policy-experts-221528">this article on Politico</a> later in the day.  This TRUMP quote just about sums it up:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“You know, I’ve always wanted to say this—I’ve never said this before with all the talking we all do—all of these experts, ‘Oh we need an expert—’ <strong>The experts are terrible</strong>,” he declared. “Look at the mess we’re in with all these experts that we have. Look at the mess. Look at the Middle East. <strong>If our presidents and our politicians went on vacation for 365 days a year and went to the beach, we’d be in much better shape right now</strong> in the Middle East.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Fucking drivel.</strong></p>
