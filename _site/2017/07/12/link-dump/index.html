  <p>First, a moment to say <code>Hello World!</code> yet again as I rebuild this blog once more <code>:)</code></p>

<h3>Link Dump</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve been consuming <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a> voraciously and done a lot more long reading in the last month or so.  I came across a few good articles to share that I just haven&#39;t gotten a chance to share yet.  I&#39;m just going to toss them in here as a list of recommendations.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15782200/one-device-secret-history-iphone-brian-merchant-book-excerpt">The Secret Origin Story of the iPhone</a></h2>

<p>This is an excerpt from a book by Brian Merchant - &quot;The One Device: The Secret History of the iPhone&quot;.  The book is a deep look at how the iconic device got made.  I was in rapture as I read this excerpt on The Verge, and I immediately went out and pre-ordered it.  I&#39;ll try to do a mini-review of the whole work after I get to read it.  </p>

<p>From the first few chapters I can tell you its not just the politics and intrigue of the iPhone&#39;s creating at Apple, but also a sprawling investigation into the physical construction of the iPhone and its impact on the world.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/olkiluoto-island-finland-nuclear-waste-onkalo">The Finish Tomb for Nuclear Waste</a></h2>

<p>This was a really awesome article I ran across on HN a few weeks ago.  It is a story about the construction of a massive permanant nuclear waste storage facility being built on Olkiluoto Island in western Finland.  The repository, called Onkalo, is built to last for 100,000 years - enough time to allow the toxic waste within de-radiate.  It&#39;s an eerie tale about human discovery and the ramifications.</p>

<h2><a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel.html">Android <code>ViewModel</code></a></h2>

<p>The thing that has my attention the most coming out of <a href="https://events.google.com/io/recap/">Google I/O</a> was the substantial architecture changes coming to Android in O.  This link is basically a reminder for myself to learn more about it and hopefully share how I use it in my own development.  For now, take a look at what they can do for yourself.</p>

<p>The one minute gist is you can now have Lifecycle-aware components that survive for the lifecycle of your activity and can be used to manage data for your Activities and their Fragments in a much cleaner and safer way then the previous patterns.  Implement a <code>ViewModel</code> and implement listeners to its members and you can create clean reactive Fragments easily.</p>

<h3>That&#39;s it for now...</h3>

<p>More to come with this blog.  For now it&#39;s a simpler more cleaner site setup that I can hopefully be vigilant in updating moving forward.  Thanks for reading.</p>
