<p><em>(Asus ZenBook 3 and MacBook are interchangeable for ‘any Competitor’ and ‘Apple product’, respectively)</em></p>

<p>Just finished re-watching Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin’s <em>Steve Jobs</em>.  If you haven’t seen it, it’s an excellent film that I highly recommend, and some very nice borderline Apple-propaganda.</p>

<p>The Verge published <a href="http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/5/30/11810132/asus-zenbook-3-apple-macbook-photo-comparison">this story</a> showing how the Asus ZenBook 3 stands up visually with the MacBook.  They also mention an important point, and that is how obviously <a href="http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/5/30/11810152/asus-zenbook-3-release-date-price-specs-computex-2016">this computer is aimed at Apple’s MacBook</a>.  It attempts to do what PC makers have always done to attack Apple computers - out spec them.  The idea is that if you compare the spec sheets by the numbers you’d have to be crazy to pick Apple hardware over their own.</p>

<p>For the record, it hasn’t really helped all that much.  Because the fact is there’s a lot more that goes into buying a computer that strictly specs for most people, and right now Apple is making consumers feel confident in spending money on Apple.  I think, more than hardcore specs, it comes down to design and Mac OS that pushes people into buying Macs.</p>

<p>I mean let’s talk about design.  The MacBook looks exceedingly cooler than the ZenBook 3.  That matte aluminum finish and the mirrored Apple logo is brilliantly minimalistic.  ZenBook has that weird reflective backplate with the utilitarian ASUS logo.  The keyboard of the ZenBook, while Asus has stepped it’s game up for this PC in that regard, can hardly compare to the Apple keyboard visual standard.  Then you have design flourishes like the speakers on the ZenBook.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZUoazJBQS3A3YuhC-Iii5JdJX3A=/1020x0/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6564697/DSCF4312.0.jpg" alt="ZenBook 3 Speakers" /></p>

<p>In my opinion, they just don’t really work.  And that’s the thing when it comes down to buying an ultrabook like this.  You’re not buying it for power, you’re not buying it to break into Windows’ OS (same goes for the MacBook, in all honesty it’s still a silly purchase for a primary PC in my opinion), and if you really need portability there are options like the Surface or much cheaper options that have more flexible port configurations.</p>

<p>So why would you buy one of these ultrabooks?  I think it comes down to design.  Basically, you buy this PC because you want to show it off.  You want the newest, thinnest, purposefully designed device.  It’s a status symbol.  So that means, for well over a thousand dollars, you expect the pinnacle of design.</p>

<p>In my opinion, it’s still hard to beat Apple’s design for the Macs.  So, <em>IF</em> I had the capital to drop on a auxiliary PC that looks amazing and performs my laptop’s normal tasks - I would still buy a MacBook.  I have yet to see a PC that would convince me otherwise.</p>
