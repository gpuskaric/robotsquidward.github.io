   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;First, a moment to say &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Hello World!&lt;/code&gt; yet again as I rebuild this blog once more &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;:)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;link-dump&quot;&gt;Link Dump&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been consuming &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.ycombinator.com/&quot;&gt;Hacker News&lt;/a&gt; voraciously and done a lot more long reading in the last month or so.  I came across a few good articles to share that I just haven’t gotten a chance to share yet.  I’m just going to toss them in here as a list of recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-secret-origin-story-of-the-iphone&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/13/15782200/one-device-secret-history-iphone-brian-merchant-book-excerpt&quot;&gt;The Secret Origin Story of the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an excerpt from a book by Brian Merchant - “The One Device: The Secret History of the iPhone”.  The book is a deep look at how the iconic device got made.  I was in rapture as I read this excerpt on The Verge, and I immediately went out and pre-ordered it.  I’ll try to do a mini-review of the whole work after I get to read it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the first few chapters I can tell you its not just the politics and intrigue of the iPhone’s creating at Apple, but also a sprawling investigation into the physical construction of the iPhone and its impact on the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-finish-tomb-for-nuclear-waste&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.wired.co.uk/article/olkiluoto-island-finland-nuclear-waste-onkalo&quot;&gt;The Finish Tomb for Nuclear Waste&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a really awesome article I ran across on HN a few weeks ago.  It is a story about the construction of a massive permanant nuclear waste storage facility being built on Olkiluoto Island in western Finland.  The repository, called Onkalo, is built to last for 100,000 years - enough time to allow the toxic waste within de-radiate.  It’s an eerie tale about human discovery and the ramifications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;android-viewmodel&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel.html&quot;&gt;Android &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ViewModel&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing that has my attention the most coming out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://events.google.com/io/recap/&quot;&gt;Google I/O&lt;/a&gt; was the substantial architecture changes coming to Android in O.  This link is basically a reminder for myself to learn more about it and hopefully share how I use it in my own development.  For now, take a look at what they can do for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one minute gist is you can now have Lifecycle-aware components that survive for the lifecycle of your activity and can be used to manage data for your Activities and their Fragments in a much cleaner and safer way then the previous patterns.  Implement a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ViewModel&lt;/code&gt; and implement listeners to its members and you can create clean reactive Fragments easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;thats-it-for-now&quot;&gt;That’s it for now…&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More to come with this blog.  For now it’s a simpler more cleaner site setup that I can hopefully be vigilant in updating moving forward.  Thanks for reading.&lt;/p&gt;
