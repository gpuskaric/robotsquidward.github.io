Hi, I'm A.J.

Developer. Always tinkering, coding, designing.

This blog is my ramblings on film, tv, music, design, development, science, culture, art and all other good things.  At least that's what I think I would like it to be.

I can be contacted by email at <a href="mailto:ajkueterman@gmail.com">ajkueterman@gmail.com</a>
