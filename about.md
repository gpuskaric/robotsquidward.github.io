Hey!  My name is A.J.  I'm a mobile developer ([cv](/cv/)) and self taught designer.  This is my blog.

The site is written in markdown using [Atom](https://atom.io/), built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and hosted with ‚ù§Ô∏è on [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/).

Check out some of the apps that I've helped build at [Base11 Studios](https://base11studios.com/portfolio/)

I also occasionally make Star Wars gifs ü§ì
